# 💻 Typing Speed Test – C++ Mini Project

A C++ console-based application to test typing speed and accuracy using user-defined sentences.  
The project calculates **Words Per Minute (WPM)** and **accuracy** using character-level comparison and provides feedback after each attempt.

## 📌 Project Info

- **Project Title:** Typing Speed Test (User-Custom Sentence)
- **Developer:** Isneha Varshney
- **Institute:** Jaypee University
- **Branch & Semester:** B.Tech CSE 
- **Created On:** June 18, 2025
- **Mode:** Learning-only console-based mini project

## 🎯 Objective

- Allow users to type any sentence of their choice  
- Measure typing speed using WPM and time  
- Calculate accuracy of user input  
- Provide feedback based on speed and correctness  
- Give option to retry with same or new sentence

---

## 💡 Key Features

- Custom sentence input by the user
- Countdown timer before typing begins
- Real-time tracking using `clock()`
- Calculates WPM and accuracy %
- Dynamic feedback system
- Allows retry attempts in loop
